# **Tuple Demonstration Script**  

### Description

This script creates a simple tuple, prints its contents, retrieves the third element from the tuple, and accesses the first element of the nested tuple. It demonstrates basic tuple operations in Python, including indexing and accessing elements.

### Pseudocode

    1. Define a tuple named `mytuple` containing various data types: an integer, a string, a float, a boolean, and another tuple.
    2. Print the entire contents of `mytuple`.
    3. Print the third element in the tuple using indexing.
    4. Print the first element of the nested tuple located as the fifth element in `mytuple`.
