# **Fruit Count Script**  

### Description

This script allows the user to input their favorite fruit and then checks how many times that fruit appears in a predefined tuple of fruits. It demonstrates basic user input handling, string manipulation, and tuple operations, specifically counting occurrences of an element.

### Pseudocode

    1. Define a tuple named `fruits` containing various fruit names, including some duplicates.
    2. Prompt the user to enter their favorite fruit, ensuring it is converted to lowercase and stripped of any surrounding whitespace.
    3. Use the `count` method on the `fruits` tuple to determine how many times the user's favorite fruit appears in the tuple.
    4. Print the result indicating how many times the entered fruit appears in the tuple.
