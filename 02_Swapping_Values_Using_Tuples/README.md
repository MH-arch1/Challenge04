# **Tuple Swapping Script**  

### Description

This script prompts the user to input two integers, creates a tuple with the entered values, and then creates another tuple that swaps the order of these values. It prints both the original tuple and the swapped tuple. This demonstrates basic tuple creation, user input, and tuple manipulation in Python.

### Pseudocode

    1. Prompt the user to enter the first number and convert it to an integer.
    2. Prompt the user to enter the second number and convert it to an integer.
    3. Create a tuple named `my_tuple` containing the first and second numbers.
    4. Print the message displaying the values in their original order.
    5. Create another tuple named `mytuple` that swaps the order of the first and second numbers.
    6. Print the message displaying the swapped values.
